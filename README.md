# Naive_Bayes_Classifier
Mathematical implementation of the Naive Bayes Classifier

## Repository contains the following files :
* monk : Data Set
* shuttle_landing :  Data Set
* Soyabean_small :  Data Set
* spect_heart : Data Set
* tic_tac_toe : Data Set
* Answers.txt : File which reports the accuracy of the classifier

## Abstract of The Project
* Implemented a naive bayes classifier for 5 different data sets. Not using inbuilt libraries but instead highlighting the math behind the classifier
* All the data set folders contains data contains following :
* Main.py : Python3 script which implements naive bayes classifier and writes the accuracy to “Answers.txt”.
* data : Data points .(Some contain multiple data files). 
  * In Spect Heart set and Monk set we have been given data set and test data, in which we can test.
  * In Shuttle Landing, Soyabean Small, Tic-Tac-Toe we have been given data set. But there are not predefined test data points, hence I have performed leave one out cross validation.
  * In Monk Data Set, 3 different data set's and corresponding test data is given. I have treated these data sets as different data sets. Trained classifier on individual data set and tested it in the corresponding test data.
  * In Shuttle Landing data set, certain points were given as don't care(‘*’). I have used the following convention in this case.
While calculating probabilities of different features,  I did not considered don't care(‘*’) as any of the feature.
While predicting probability of different classes of the test data point, I have taken probability of don't care as 1, as don't care can be any feature 
* Accuracy reported in this data set = (no. of passed test cases in all the three data sets)/(total number of data points).
* Formula Used :
